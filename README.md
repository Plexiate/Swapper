I run this Vanilla minecraft server and there I sat needing to assign permissions for a specific user that would allow them to use spectator mode when they needed to but also retain the ability of survival.

I tried googling the issue only to find posts mentioning to use "essentials.gamemode.creative" or something the like --This had to affect and the user was still unable to use it. I also tried bukkit.gamemode and minecraft.gamemode. None of them would work.

After not being able to find any way to set permissions with what I had I just settled with the result... for months. Well not anymore! There's Swapper™ on the streets!!

Swapper™ is a ultra-lightweight minimalistic plugin that allows players to change gamemodes based on a permission that works!


Permissions
    - swapper.survival
    - swapper.creative
    - swapper.spectator
    - swapper.adventure
    - swapper.sreload


Commands
    - /survival
    - /creative
    - /spectator
    - /adventure
    - /sreload
    

Usage Tutorial:

1. Download most up to date jar file.
2. Drop into server.
3. Use permissions editor of your choice and add the permissions for the gamemodes you want a user to have access to.

Giving "swapper.survival" and "swapper.spectator" will allow a user to only change between survival and spectator.
